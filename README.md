# Ansible Collection - cdillc.splunk

## Contents

See the [official docs](https://cdillc-splunk.readthedocs.io/) for the expanded list of all supported functionality.
Recent updates are documented in the [changelog](https://github.com/Kintyre/ansible-collection-splunk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
Below is a brief summary of current features.


### Modules

| Module | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [ksconf_package](https://cdillc-splunk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collections/cdillc/splunk/ksconf_package_module) | Build a Splunk app package from a source app containing [ksconf](https://github.com/Kintyre/ksconf) layers.  Individual layers can be enabled or disabled based on ansible variables.  (This works for non-layered apps too.)  This module is idempotent, making it possible to conditionally roll out changes.  Use this instead of `command: ksconf package ...` |
| [ksconf_app_sideload](https://cdillc-splunk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collections/cdillc/splunk/ksconf_app_sideload_module) | Install a Splunk app from a tarball (`.tar.gz` or `.spl`) into a Splunk instance using a sideload technique.  The tarball is extracted into `apps` (where a normal "install" is suitable, or into management folders (i.e., `deployment-apps`, `manager-apps`, `shcluster/apps`) where Splunk provides no official install utility.  On the surface, this is similar to Ansible's `unarchive` module except with much better idempotent behavior; `unarchive` checks to see if the top-level destination folder exists, whereas this module can track installation version and checksum to determine when the archive should be expanded.  (Some of these features are a work in progress; at the moment this is *very* much like Ansible's `unarchive`)  (Please don't confuse this with `ksconf unarchive` which handles getting tarballs into a repository, not installing apps into a Splunk instance.) |
| [splunk_cli](https://cdillc-splunk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collections/cdillc/splunk/splunk_cli_module) | Execute a `splunk` command locally or remotely (via a remote Splunkd URI). Unlike using the built-in `command` module, the `password` field alone is marked NO_LOG, so it's possible to see the rest of the command in the logs making troubleshooting easier and auditing more accurate.   Use this instead of `command: "{{splunk_home}}/bin/splunk ..."` |
| [splunk_control](https://cdillc-splunk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collections/cdillc/splunk/splunk_control_module) | Use the REST API to stop/restart a running Splunk instance.  This may replace the use of `service`, but both options have advantages in specific use cases. |
| [splunk_facts](https://cdillc-splunk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collections/cdillc/splunk/splunk_facts_module) | Collect various facts about a Splunk installation.  Supports multiple instance by specifying the `splunk_home` or standard install locations will be checked. |
| [splunk_rest_conf](https://cdillc-splunk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collections/cdillc/splunk/splunk_rest_conf_module) | Manipulate various `.conf` files of a running Splunk instance over the REST API.  Use this instead of  `uri: url=https://localhost:8089/services/configs/conf-{type}/... ` |
| [splunk_user](https://cdillc-splunk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collections/cdillc/splunk/splunk_user_module) | Manipulate local Splunk user accounts.  Add, delete, modify, or change password. |


### Filters

| Filter | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [reltime_to_sec](https://cdillc-splunk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collections/cdillc/splunk/reltime_to_sec_filter) | Convert a Splunk relative time string into seconds.  For example, in indexes.conf: `frozenTimePeriodInSecs = {{ "7d" \|  cdillc.splunk.reltime_to_sec }}`.  The suffixes `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `y` are supported. |

### Playbooks

| Playbook | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `install_dependencies.yml` | Install python dependencies.  Specify the targeted group by setting `splunk_host`. |

Run any of the above playbooks using the collection's prefix and without the `.yml`.  For example, to install dependencies to the _full_ group, run
```bash
ansible-playbook cdillc.splunk.install_dependencies -e splunk_host=full
```

## Testing

Until we get automatic testing working, here are some commands to do testing

Inventory file:
```
localhost ansible_connection=local splunk_home=~/splunk
```


```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install . --force





export SPLUNK_HOME=~/splunk
ansible -i inventory -m cdillc.splunk.splunk_cli -a "splunk_home={{splunk_home}} cmd=version" all
ansible -i inventory -m cdillc.splunk.splunk_control -a "state=restarted username=admin password=PASSWORD timeout=20" all

ansible -m cdillc.splunk.ksconf_package -a "source=/data/repos/my_apps/kintyre-spl file=/tmp/kintyre-splunk-app.spl local=preserve" localhost
ansible -m cdillc.splunk.ksconf_app_sideload -a "src=/tmp/kintyre-splunk-app.spl dest=$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps list_files=true" localhost

ansible -m debug  -a 'msg="Keep day for {{ "7d" | cdillc.splunk.reltime_to_sec }} seconds"' localhost

ansible -i inventory -m cdillc.splunk.splunk_user -a "state=present splunk_user=new_user splunk_pass=anewpassword username=admin password=$SPLUNK_PASS roles=user" splunk

ansible -m cdillc.splunk.ksconf_app_sideload -a "src=splunk-ta-aws-5.0.0-e3e6808.spl dest=/opt/splunk/etc/deployment-apps" -b --become-user splunk --become-password-file x splunk -i inventory

ansible -m cdillc.splunk.splunk_facts splunk -i inventory -b --become-user splunk --become-password-file x
```



### Developer mode install

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/cdillc
ln -s $(pwd) ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/cdillc/splunk
```

Possible alternative approach would be to use `ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH`, but you have to have the parent directories setup correctly, so the above symlink seems to work well enough, but it of course impacts the version used by the entire user.


### Make it possible to import module_utils during development
```bash
mkdir -p ansible_collections/cdillc/splunk
ln -s ../../../plugins ansible_collections/cdillc/splunk/
```

Add to `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
    "python.analysis.stubPath": ".",
```
